Hello.

I love code challenges, but I don't believe in competition. Codewars is a popular website where you can find many code challenges (which they call katas), but you can only access other people's answers after you pass the tests yourself.

Although I love Codewars, I don't think this is productive when you learn something new. With this repository, I intend to explain how I got to each answer to whoever wandered here from Google, and challenge myself to complete two katas per day.

I am completing the katas in order from easiest (8 kyu) to hardest (1 kyu).

Each file is organized in the following manner:

1. Kata title
2. Kata description
3. My answer
4. My reasoning
5. Url to the original kata

Feel free to reach me at lenaaraujo92@gmail.com. I hope we can learn together.

Much love,
Lena.
