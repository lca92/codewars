// Chuck Norris VII - True or False? (Beginner)

// It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has to use the word false.

// It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.

// Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually using the word false...

// Go show some truth who's boss!

// My answer:

const ifChuckSaysSo = () => !true;

// My reasoning:
// 1. We have to return a falsy value.
// 2. The not operator (!) evaluates an element to its logical opposite.
// 3. The opposite of true is false.
