// 5 without numbers !!

// DESCRIPTION:
// Write a function that always returns 5

// Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789*+-/

// Good luck :)

// My answer:

const unusualFive = () => "cinco".length;

// My reasoning:
// 1. I'll pass the tests if I write any five-character string and ask for its length.
// 2. Why not write "five" itself, but at the same time show off my Portuguese knowledge?
