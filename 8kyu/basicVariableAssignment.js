// Basic variable assignment

// This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

// My answer:

var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;

// My reasoning:
// 1. The original code had equality operators (==) instead of the equal sign we should use when declaring a variable.
// 2. Equality operators should be used when we want to compare two operands.
