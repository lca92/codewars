// Function 1 - hello world

// Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

// Style Points
// Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

// My answer:

const greet = () => `hello world!`;

// My reasoning:
// 1. We just have to return the string "hello world!"
