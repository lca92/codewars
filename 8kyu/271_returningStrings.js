// Returning Strings

// DESCRIPTION:
// Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

// [Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

// My answer:

const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;

// My reasoning:
// 1. Using arrow function and template literals, I substitute the placeholder name with the given string.
